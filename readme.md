# Control charts

## In brevi

This repository contains files to calculate Shewhart control charts, also called process behaviour charts. These charts are used to determine if the variation of a process is stable and predictable, that is, in a state of statistical control. In-control variation arises from chance or common causes. No changes or adjustments to the process are needed. The charts can be used to predict future performance. Out-of-control variation arises from special or assignable causes. These charts help identify the special causes in order minimize or eliminate their effect.
